# hint-hint
A website for forgetful people to log their upcoming events and receive text message reminders.

Due to Twilio trial account restrictions, texts will only be sent to the RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER and not the phone number that is used to sign up. To avoid confusion, please use the same phone number for both.

### To try it out:

* npm install
* Create your own .env file based off of the env.sample provided
* npm run seed
* npm start
